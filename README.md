# MultiAgentSystem-Virus-Model
This model represents an (approximate) simulation of the spread of an airborne virus (similar to the covid19) and the influence of the different control measures against this virus (lockdown, barrier gesture, travel restrictions, mask...).

This project was carried out as part of the course AI961 - Self-organising multi-agent systems at Télécom Paris.
